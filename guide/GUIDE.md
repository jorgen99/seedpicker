# The Seedpicker guide for creating your own seed phrase

_This guide aims to educate the reader in a learning-by-doing
fashion. However, it does not make any guarantees or promises, and does
not take any responsibility for what anyone does with this material._

## What you need

* A PC or laptop capable of running Ubuntu. Almost any old computer will
  do. A hard drive is NOT needed.
* A CD or a USB Stick prepared with Ubuntu Live. CD is recommended
(usually easier for newbies, and completely read-only). If you havenâ€™t
created one of those before, the following tutorial is a good starting
point: **bit.ly/2QD8mjC**
* A printout of **[the raffle ticket cutouts](SeedPicker_Ticket_Cutouts.pdf)**.
* A printout of **[the seed form](SeedPicker_Seed_Form.pdf)**.
* A printout of **[the lookup table](SeedPicker_Lookup_Table.pdf)**.
(Can also be read from the screen, but a printout is recommended)
* A printout of this guide. (Can also be read from a screen, but a
  printout is recommended)
* A single 6-sided die. ðŸŽ²

There are two ways of generating the 23 words. One that uses a a lookup
table and one that uses a webpage.  If you opt for the Lookup
Table-version you'll also need: 

* A pair of scissors. âœ„ 
* A small bag or box to put the raffle tickets in. An ordinary plastic
bag works fine.

## Part 1: Generation of 23 random words
Human beings are really bad at randomness! When randomness is important,
you should never rely on something that comes from a human brain!
Modern computers are getting better at creating randomness, but it is
still difficult to make computerized randomness in a way that is
transparent to us humans. In other words, it is hard to convince humans
that a random number has been created in a truly random fashion. This is
the reason most public lotteries use physical and transparent lotto
machines instead of using computerized randomness; It is crucial to
convince the audience that the randomness is real and not manipulated in
any way.

You can create the seed phrase manually using a lookup table in one of
two ways. The Lookup Table or The Dice page.

### 1.1 Lookup Table

This method uses a combination of raffle tickets and a six-sided playing
die to create very good natural and transparent randomness.

This is how you do it: 

* Use the scissors to cut out the 342 raffle tickets and put them in the
bag (or box). Make sure you donâ€™t lose any of them. Mix them around
thoroughly!

* Use the seed form, the raffle tickets, and the 6-sided die to pick the
first 23 words. Read the instructions on the Seed Form carefully, and
make sure to follow them all.

When finished, you should have a sheet of paper with 23 secret words,
generated with a very high degree of randomness.  Randomness that you
yourself have witnessed. Donâ€™t ever let anybody see what you have
written on your Seed Form!

### 1.2 Dice Rolling page

This method is an automated version of the lookup table that uses one
die and the Dice Rolling page that has the lookup table built-in. If you
don't want to bother with cutting raffle tickets this method is for you. 
The downside is that there's a lot of dice rolling. If you're interested
in the math behind this method see the last paragraph in this section.

This is how you do it:

* Roll the die
* Enter the value in the first input-field.
* Repeat 10 times until you have filld all 11 fields
* Click the "Add Word"-button
* Repeat the steps above 22 times
* Write the seed phrase down on a piece of paper
* Click the "Copy Phrase"-button to go to the checksum calulation page. 

This bears repeating: Don't ever let anybody see your seed phrase!

If you're not interested in the math behind this metod you can go to
Part 2.

#### 1.3 Explanation
The BIP39 dictionary consists of 2048 words. 2048 can be represented
in binary with 11 bits. 11^2 = 2048. If you roll a die, treat 1-3 
as a 0, 4-6 as a 1 and repeat this eleven times then we get a binary
number that corresponds to a word in the word list.

Instead of using a die you could use a coin and use heads and tails
to generate your 11 bits.  

## Part 2: Calculating the 24th word

The last word of a 24 word seed is a checksum word, calculated using the
other 23 words as input. Unfortunately, we need to use a computer for
this step. Since we need to enter our super secret 23 words into a
computer, it must be a super secure computer! It must be offline and we
must make sure all the secret data is completely discarded after
shutdown.  Follow the steps below to achieve this!


### 2a: Prepare hardware and software 

* Open up the computer and remove the hard drive. This step is to
convince you that nothing will be saved to the hard drive. If you feel
certain that this will not happen, you can skip this step.

* Remove any removable media from the computer.

* Boot up Ubuntu and run it in Live mode ("Try Ubuntu before
  installing").

* Make sure you have a working Internet connection, wired or wireless
(Click the small triangle on the top right of the Ubuntu desktop).

* Open Firefox and type in the following address:

```seedpicker.net/calculator/last-word.html```

This is the **SeedPicker last word calculator**. Let the page load but
**DO NOT ENTER ANYTHING IN THE FORM AT THIS POINT!**

*Tip for advanced users: Open a second tab and navigate to
```iancoleman.io/bip39```, but **DO NOT ENTER ANYTHING AT THIS POINT!**
Having this page pre-loaded will later enable you to double-check the
validity of the generated seed phrase, right before you shut down the
computer.*

Note that the code on the web page(s) downloaded in the previous step
_does not need to be trusted_!  Why? Because the 23 words that we
created and wrote on paper in the previous step cannot be changed by any
software!

However, we do have to make sure that the secret information will not
leak to the outside world, or to future users of the same computer._
This is achieved by disabling all communication and by shutting the
computer off when we are done.  This is covered below.

### 2b: Disable all communication
The secure computer is now fully configured and the next step is to go
**completely offline**:

* Pull any network cable.

* Disable all wireless communication (e.g. by enabling airplane mode).
* Make absolutely sure you are now offline, and from now on: Don't go
online again until after you have restarted the computer!!
* Make sure nobody else can see your screen!
* Make sure nobody else can see your keyboard!
* Make sure nobody else can see your Seedpicker Seed Form!

### 2c: Perform the calculation 

Go back to Firefox and the **SeedPicker last word
calculator**. Following the instructions on the page, enter your 23
words into the field and press the button.

Use your pen to type the resulting 24th word into the designated cell of
the Seed Form.

**Shut down the computer**. Make sure it is completely turned off.  

## Summary

You have now generated a valid BIP39 seed phrase and the only existing
record of it is the Seed Form. Keep it really secret. You may want to
make copies and put in different locations. If you create copies, do it
manually. Don't use a copier, camera or any form of computer.

This guide does not cover how to store your seed phrase securely, so do
your research well.

If you intend to use the seed phrase with a hardware wallet, it is
recommended to use the *passphrase* feature (sometimes called the 25th
word) and keep the two phrases separated.
